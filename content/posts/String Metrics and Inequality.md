Recently, while researching common algorithms (specifically the Levenshtein Distance) I noticed that it's codomain (Positive Integers), when mapped onto booleans in the usual way (`False` if `=0`, `True` otherwise) has the same values as string inequality! That's a small observation, but I did really enjoy it nevertheless. Sadly, all my attempts to assign an existing to this operator have failed.

For a long time I have been dreaming of a website, where I would post my thoughts on different topics whenever they arise, so I made it myself. Don't get me wrong, social networks and blogging websites are amazing, however they lack my custom touch, which this one doesn't. Deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4, served through NginX, statically generated by Hugo and remotely stored on GitHub. My most ambicious web development project so far. Probably you are looking at it this very second. Not exactly my biggest work, but an window to view all my other [projects](https://kittenlover.ru/projects) through. Batteries included.
